            <h1>Intervention mid-level 03<br>
                Color Reducer
            </h1>
            <div class="midDescription">
                A combined experiment of low #17 (Glasses that tone down the color of screens but keep the rest of the world colorful) & low #21 (People-safe color palette). <br><br>
                With this experiment, I took two approaches: a mathematical reduction and a filter. The mathematical reduction can either be 75% of an RGB value or 75% of the saturation in an HSL value.
                The filter can either be a 50% opacity layer of black on top of the image or 50% reduction of saturation and contrast.

            <h3>Why it was selected</h3>
            <div class="midDescription">
                I created a poll asking people about which of my low-fidelity interventions they liked the most. #17 (Glasses that tone down the color of screens) was popular and I decided to combine it with #21 (People-safe color palette). I also chose to combine the two because a solution like #17 <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ivancash/irl-glasses-glasses-that-block-screens" target="_blank" class="outbound">already existed</a>.
            </div>
            <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <div class="midDescription">
                Initially, I had only gotten feedback on the color filters. However, the filters alone felt like they were lacking and I was more interested in an algorithmic solution which led me to the mathematical reductions.
