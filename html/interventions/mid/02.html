            <h3>Why it was selected</h3>
            <div class="midDescription">
                I chose to continue with this idea for two reasons: 1) It was a physical idea so it broke the digital barrier and 2) compared to some of my other ideas, this one was more focused on positive reinforcement.

            <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <div class="midDescription">
                Unfortunately I was not able to get a lot of feedback on the prototype because the fidelity of the prototype did not result in realistic interactions.
