            <h3>Why it was selected</h3>
            <div class="midDescription">
                I created a poll asking people about which of my low-fidelity interventions they liked the most. This was the most popular and since it seemed feasible I went forward with it.

            <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <div class="midDescription">
                At this stage, this application went through several iterations. After learning AppleScript and building the basic application, I started to add more to it. I added the ability to wait a short period of time so that people could finish their train of thought before looking away. I also made the application force itself to the top and play a sound to make it harder to ignore.
                The biggest criticism I got was that the countdown timer was distracting when a user was supposed to not look at the screen.
