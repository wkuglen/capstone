            <h3>Why it was selected</h3>
            <div class="midDescription">
                I chose to continue prototyping this application because I had the most feedback for it and I knew it would be the best intervention to iterate and build upon.
            </div>

            <h3>Feedback & Future Iterations</h3>
            <div class="midDescription">
                The biggest change was removing the countdown timer and making the screen turn off by setting the brightness to 0. I also limited the number of times someone could wait and delay the application.
                In testing the application, people would typically look away from the blank screen, so it could be considered a success. However, people also found it annoying, especially when they were "in the zone."
                <br><br>
                Other features I would like to add would be the ability to play audio while the screen is off. For example, the audio could tell a random fact, play music, or tell a story.
                Another feature (although computationally intensive) would use computer vision and face detection to make sure the user is looking away or has their eyes closed.
